# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Republish the currently deployed draft app to the Internet Computer exactly as-is.

**Planned changes:**
- Re-run the build and deployment/publish process using the current repository state.
- Make no modifications to any frontend or backend source files.

**User-visible outcome:** The same app (unchanged UI/features, English text) is available via a newly produced deployment for preview/publishing on the Internet Computer.
