  "summary": "The diff modifies a repository file (project_state.json) and does not provide evidence of a rebuild/redeploy. It also introduces/request-tracks multiple additional features explicitly listed as non-goals, which conflicts with the BuildRequest constraint to republish without code changes or new features/UI changes.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Re-run the build and deploy/publish the currently deployed draft app to the Internet Computer without making any code changes (republish exactly as-is).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows an edit to project_state.json and contains no evidence of any build/deploy action or deployment output/accessibility. Additionally, a codebase change is present, which conflicts with the 'exactly as-is' constraint.",
